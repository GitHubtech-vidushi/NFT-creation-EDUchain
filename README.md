#  NFT Creation

##  Project Title
**NFT Creation** - A Solidity-based smart contract for minting unique Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) from scratch without using OpenZeppelin.

---

##  Project Description

The **NFT Creation** project enables creators to mint their own NFTs directly on the Ethereum blockchain using a custom-built smart contract. The contract is developed from scratch, following the ERC-721 standard logic, without relying on external libraries like OpenZeppelin. This provides complete control and transparency over how tokens are created, assigned, and managed.

---

##  Project Vision

To offer a lightweight and fully customizable NFT contract, empowering developers and creators to learn, innovate, and build NFT-based applications from the ground up without external dependencies. The project serves as an educational and practical example for understanding how NFT standards work internally.

---

##  Key Features

-  **Custom ERC-721 Logic**: No OpenZeppelin; built from scratch.
-  **Owner-Controlled Minting**: Only the deployer can mint NFTs.
-  **Token Metadata**: Each token has its own `tokenURI` for external content (e.g. art, music).
-  **Ownership Tracking**: View token owners and balances with public functions.
-  **Transfer Events**: Emits standard `Transfer` events when tokens are minted.

---

##  Future Scope

-  **Transfer Functionality**: Add safe transfer between users.
-  **Minting Fees**: Allow public minting with payments to owner.
-  **User Minting Access**: Add whitelist or permission-based minting.
-  **Metadata Decentralization**: Integrate IPFS or Arweave.
-  **Frontend Interface**: Build a simple UI using React or HTML/JS to interact with the contract.

> ðŸ”§ This is an ideal starting point to deeply understand how NFTs are created and managed on Ethereum, with maximum transparency and full control.
